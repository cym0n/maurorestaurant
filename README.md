Strehler
========

Strehler is a light-weight, nerdy, smart CMS in perl based on __Perl Dancer2 framework__.

Yo can use it to easily create the backend of the site you're working on or to manage the data in your database.

At this moment you can't install Strehler from cpan, but you can easily copy all the libraries you need in your Dancer2 project and start from that.

Look at the [project wiki](https://github.com/cym0n/strehler/wiki) for more informations.
